Data Warehouse & Analytics Project with MySQL
Hi! ðŸ‘‹ This is a portfolio project where I built a complete data warehouse system using MySQL. The goal was to bring together data from different sources, clean it up, store it properly, and make it ready for analysis and reporting.

ðŸ“Œ What This Project Is About
In this project, I worked on:

Designing the Data Warehouse: I followed the Medallion Architecture with three layers â€” Bronze (raw data), Silver (cleaned data), and Gold (final analytics-ready data).

ETL Process: I created pipelines to Extract data from CSV files (ERP & CRM systems), Transform it to fix quality issues, and Load it into the warehouse.

Data Modeling: I built fact and dimension tables to organize the data in a way that's easy to analyze.

Analytics: I used SQL to write queries and generate insights and dashboards.

ðŸŽ¯ Skills & Tools Demonstrated
This project showcases skills in:

SQL Development

Data Engineering & ETL

Data Modeling

Data Analytics

Itâ€™s perfect for roles like Data Analyst, ETL Developer, or Data Engineer.

ðŸš§ Project Goals and Setup
Objective: Build a modern data warehouse to bring together sales data for better reporting and decision-making.

Data Sources: I used two CSV files (ERP and CRM data) as input.

Data Cleaning: I cleaned and fixed the data before using it.

Integration: I combined both data sources into one easy-to-use data model.

Scope: I focused only on the most recent data (no history tracking).

Documentation: I explained the data model clearly so itâ€™s easy to understand for both business and technical users.
